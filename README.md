Tarina
======

![Tarina Leone, one done & one in post processing stage](docs/tarina-leone.jpg)

A video camera that organizes takes, shots & scenes and glues your film together. 

Experience filmmaking flow
------------------------------
If you don't like how your [montage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montage_(filmmaking)) flows, retake. Once you "get it" thereâ€™s no need for editing. The camera is designed with a "hackers/makers philosophy" and is easy to take apart. It's built using the Raspberry Pi, running on a Gnu/Linux Raspbian distribution and with a python coded interface.

Hardware
--------
Making default hardware changes! Woking with the [Pimoroni HyperPixel 4.0 screen](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4?variant=12569539706963) and a new more juicy charger powerbooster. Also doing rework on the 3d printable case and microphone.

The parts are built around the world by different manufacturers. They've been chosen on the basis of features, quality, openness, availabilty and price. One of the central ideas of the project is to have a camera that could be upgraded or repaired by the fact that you easily just switch a component. The casis of the camera is all 3d printable with a design that has the key element of flipping the lens 180 (gonzo style). Here's the main components:

Software
--------
The interface focuses on presenting the essentials for film making in one menu that is present and accessible all the time. You can control the interface with a keyboard or with 9 physical buttons; Enter, Up, Down, Left, Right, Record, Retake, View and Remove.

Installing
----------
Download latest [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and follow [install instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).
[Ssh into](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) Raspberry Pi and run:
```
sudo apt-get install git
```
Go to /home/pi/ folder
```
cd /home/pi
```
Git clone tarina and then run install script with sudo:
```
git clone https://github.com/rbckman/tarina.git
cd tarina
sudo ./install.sh
```
You'r ready to rumble:
```
python3 tarina.py
```

Why
---
There are several reasons why, will write a longer story why but heres some fundamentals that has kept me going.

- be able to repair if something breaks
- be able to expand / build on it / make modifications
- be able to connect to it / program it to do things
- do a film on the fly without the need of another computer
- be able to watch your film directly on a screen once you're done filming
- learn about programming and your own crafts to really get down to the nitty-gritty.
